    <img src="../images/japanese-christmas-cake.webp">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This traditional Japanese Christmas cake recipe is a favorite of cookbook author, recipe developer, and Allrecipes Allstar Lisa Childs, 
        who makes it every year for the holidays. It's a super-light, delicious sponge cake layered with fresh whipped cream and strawberries.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 large eggs, separated and at room temperature</li>
        <li>22 tablespoons white sugar, divided</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups cake flour, sifted</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons avocado or grapeseed oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons whole milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons orange liqueur, such as Grand Marnier®</li>
        <li>3 cups whipping cream</li>
        <li>1/2 to 3/4 cup powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 pound fresh strawberries, sliced (3 cups)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 320°F, grease an 8-inch cake pan, and line it with parchment paper extending above the edges.</li>
            <li>Beat egg yolks with 10 tablespoons of sugar until pale and thick, then clean the beaters.</li>
            <li>Whip egg whites with 6 tablespoons of sugar until glossy, medium-stiff peaks form.</li>
            <li>Gently fold one-third of the egg white mixture into the egg yolk mixture, then fold in the remaining two-thirds without deflating the batter.</li>
            <li>Stir together salt and flour, then sift and fold the flour mixture into the batter in two stages until fully combined.</li>
            <li>Warm oil and milk, then fold into the batter until well combined, keeping it airy.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan and gently tap it on the countertop to remove air bubbles.</li>
            <li>Bake the cake until golden brown and a thermometer reads at least 190°F, then invert onto a wire rack and let cool.</li>
            <li>Make simple syrup by mixing hot water, liqueur, and 6 tablespoons of sugar until dissolved, then let it cool.</li>
            <li>Whip cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla in a food processor until stiff peaks form.</li>
            <li>Slice the cooled cake into three 1-inch layers, brush each with simple syrup, and place one layer on a cake plate.</li>
            <li>Spread 3/4 cup of whipped cream on the first cake layer, top with a third of the strawberries, and another 3/4 cup of whipped cream; then repeat with the second and third cake layers.</li>
            <li>Frost the top and sides of the cake with whipped cream and garnish with the remaining strawberries.</li>
            <li>Chill the cake for 1 to 4 hours before serving, then cut into 10 slices.</li>
        </ol>
